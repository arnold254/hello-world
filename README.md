# hello-world
Hi,
I'm Arnold. I just developed a new interest in programming, which is something I think I'll be doing for a very long time. So I came to github. I'm just getting  started and learning how things work and so far I'm loving it..

I just created my first project called 'hello world!', and a this branch called 'read-me edits'.
